					<h2><u>What is this Game</u> ?</h2><br>
			
					<div align="justify">
						Blackjack, also known as twenty-one, is a comparing card game between usually several players and a dealer, whereeach 	player in turn competes against the dealer, but players do not play against each other.<br><br>
		
						The objective of the game is to beat the dealer in one of the following ways:<br><br>
		
						-> Get 21 points on the player's first two cards (called a "blackjack" or "natural"), without a dealer blackjack.br><br	>
						
						-> Reach a final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21; or<br><br>
						
						-> Let the dealer draw additional cards until their hand exceeds 21.<br><br>
		
						Players are each dealt two cards, face up or down depending on the casino and the table at which you sit. Thedealer 	is also dealt two cards, normally one up (exposed) and one down (hidden). The value of cards twothrough ten is their 	pip value (2 through 10). Face cards (Jack, Queen, and King) are all worth ten. Aces canbe worth one or eleven. A 	hand's value is the sum of the card values. Players are allowed to draw additionalcards to improve their hands. <br><br>
		
						Once all the players have completed their hands, it is the dealerâ€™s turn. The dealer hand will not be completedif all 	players have either busted or received blackjacks. The dealer then reveals the hidden card and must hituntil the 	cards total 17 or more points. Players win by not busting and having a total higher than the dealer,or not busting 	and having the dealer bust, or getting a blackjack without the dealer getting a blackjack. Ifthe player and dealer 	have the same total (not counting blackjacks), this is called a "push", and the playertypically does not win or lose 	money on that hand. Otherwise, the dealer wins. If a player receives 21 on the1st and 2nd card it is considered a 	"natural" or "blackjack" and the player is paid out immediately unlessdealer also has a natural, in which case the 	hand ties.
